#Mixed Messages
=================
##About this project
----------------------
This project is a simple program that generates a random message of movie quotes whenever the script is run.
To achieve this, I will be using:
1. JavaScript
2. GitHub
3. MarkDown

###Topic of Messages:
The topic of the random messages to be generated will be movie quotes.  This will take individual words from various movie quotes and combine them together randomly to create new quotes.

The goal of this project will be to eventually implement it into a website as a small mini game.
